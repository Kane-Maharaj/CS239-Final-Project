Play game [here](https://kane-maharaj.github.io/CS239-Final-Project/)


I used twine to create the game and it was very easy to use and understand, and anything I couldn't figure out how to to was easily found through a google search. The game itself is not very complex, but I do believe it is very informative and quickly shows how fact someone can be decieved by false information. I had a lot more fun with the project than I thought I was going to have. As for the class, I enjoyed it and although it definetly applies more to people in the CS industry, I would recommend it to people outside the field. There was a lot to consider through discussions in the class, especially revolving around the ethicality of AI.
